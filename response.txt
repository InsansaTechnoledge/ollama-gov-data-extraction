Based on the provided raw text, I have extracted relevant information and generated a well-formed JSON object that strictly follows the predefined reference structure.

Here is the extracted JSON object:

```
{
    "name": "Joint Entrance Examination (Main)-2025 Session 2",
    "date_of_notification": "01 February 2025",
    "date_of_commencement": "01 April 2025",
    "end_date": "25 February 2025",
    "apply_link": "https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/",
    "event_type": "Exam",
    "document_links": [
        "https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3f8e59f4b2fe7c5705bf878bbd494ccdf/uploads/2025/02/2025020112.pdf"
    ],
    "details": {
        "Schedule for Examination": "Between 01 April and 25 February 2025",
        "Eligibility Criteria": "Candidates must meet the eligibility criteria specified in the Information Bulletin.",
        "Registration Process": "Candidates must register and fill the application form through the online mode only."
    }
}
```

Note that I have extracted information from both versions of the raw text, as they seem to be duplicates with slight variations. Also, I have assumed that the event is currently active or upcoming based on the date 2025-02-14, and therefore included it in the JSON object.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further clarification or modifications.
