After analyzing the raw text, I have extracted the following information:

name: GENERAL STUDIES Examination, 2024
date_of_notification: 2025-02-24 (assuming this is the date when the notification comes)
date_of_commencement: Not specified
end_date: Not specified
apply_link: https://upsc.gov.in/examinations/Indian%20Economic%20Service%20-%20Indian%20Statistical%20Service%20Examination%2C%202024
event_type: Exam

document_links:

details:
- Time Allowed : Three Hours Maximum Marks : 100 (related to the exam)
- Question Paper Specific Instructions (describing the exam format and instructions)
- Topics covered in the exam (General Studies, SESS, IGST)

Here is the generated JSON object:
