2. **date_of_notification**: The date when the notification was sent out is December 11, 2024.
3. **date_of_commencement** and **end_date**: These fields are not mentioned in the raw text, so I left them as null.
4. **apply_link**: The link to apply for the examination is provided in the raw text.
5. **event_type**: Based on the content of the raw text, I determined that this is an "Exam" event.
6. **document_links**: An array of URLs related to the document links mentioned in the raw text.

Please note that I used the date 2024-12-11 for date_of_notification, as it was specified in the raw text. If no specific date is mentioned, I left it empty. Similarly, I set end_date to null since it wasn't mentioned in the raw text.
