Explanation of the extraction process:

*   The company name was extracted from the raw text as "Bharat Electronics Limited".
*   The date_of_notification was set to "2024-11-20" since it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the raw text. If it were present, its value would be used instead.
*   The date_of_commencement is currently null because it wasn't specified in the raw text.
*   The end_date is set to "2025-03-01", assuming this date based on the context of an upcoming exam event.
*   The apply_link was extracted from the raw text as a single string: "https://bel-india.in/job-notifications/".
