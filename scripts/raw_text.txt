Consider the following statements
regarding the end conditions and
internal conditions of a conjugate
beam :

1. A stable and statically determinate
real beam will have a conjugate
beam which is also stable and
statically determinate.

2. An unstable real beam will have
statically indeterminate conjugate
beam. Hence if a conjugate beam
is found to be statically in-
determinate, it is concluded that
the real beam is unstable and
further analysis is not appropriate.

3. A statically indeterminate. real
beam will have stable conjugate
beam. Hence its conjugate load
must be such that it maintains
equilibrium.

Consider the following _ statements
regarding the dependency of crane load

capacity :

1. The size of the crawlers is not a
factor due to diminutive mounting
which decreases the stability of
any footing.

2. The strength of the boom is also
one of the major governing factors
in establishing load ratings, and
any extension of the boom reduces
the rating. Lowering the boom
also increases the clearance radius
and thus reduces the rated
capacity.

3. The counterweight is added to the
after-end of the machine. Manu-
facturer’s specifications provided
standard and maximum counter-
weights and also the crane ratings.
Counter weights may be increased
to a specified maximum, but the
operating radius must not exceed
that given by the manufacturer.
